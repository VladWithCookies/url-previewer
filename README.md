# Notes
## Demo
https://vladwithcookies.github.io/url-previewer/

## Features
* Some kind of caching system for preventing of unnecessary requests
* Using of `debounce` to prevent unnecessary requests
* Filtering of duplicating URLs to prevent unnecessary requests

## Challenges
* It is not so fun to use `debounce` with `React` hooks ;)
* It was nice to try hooks one more time (in my current projects class components are still common approach)

## TODO
* Better error handling
* Create custom hook to add potential ability to reuse URL preview logic
* Handle more cases (some websites can provide meta data in unexpected formats)
* Tests
